            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Jake Adelman. I am a first-year Civil Engineering student at the 
                University of South Carolina. I am interested in construction, structural design, 
                and how technology and software can help solve real-world problems. I enjoy working 
                with my hands, learning new tools, and building projects that connect engineering and computing.
            </p>
            <p>
                My mission is to keep improving my technical skills in both coding and civil engineering, 
                so I can work on projects that are useful, efficient, and safe. I want to bring my work 
                ethic from construction and sports into my classes, internships, and future career.

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    A short description of a real-world problem my team and I identified and want 
                    to solve using a computing-based solution. The document explains the situation, 
                    who is affected, and why the problem matters.

                <p>
                    An affinity diagram that organizes ideas related to our problem statement. 
                    We grouped similar ideas together to see patterns and decide which features 
                    and directions are most important for our solution.

                    Each sketch includes multiple panels to show how a user would move through 
                    the app or website and interact with the main features.

                <h3>Code Sample 1 – Stock Transaction Program</h3>
                <p>
                    Java console program that calculates the results of a stock trade. The user enters
                    the number of shares, purchase price, sale price, and commissions, and the program
                    computes the total cost, total sale amount, and profit or loss. This sample shows
                    basic Java input, output, arithmetic, and formatting.

                <p>
                    Java program that converts a distance value from one unit to another. The user
                    enters a distance and the program shows the converted value. This code practices
                    using variables, calculations, and simple user interaction in Java.

            <section class="project">
                <h3>Code Sample 3 – Concert Promoter</h3>
                <p>
                    Java application that helps a concert promoter estimate ticket revenue. Based on
                    ticket price, number of tickets sold, and expenses, the program calculates total
                    income and profit. This example shows how to combine user input with arithmetic
                    to solve a practical problem.
